==> Missing Deliverable: (3.5/5, 70% of the grade worth is missing) 

-	Document your meeting at the wiki page of your repo or under the issues. (at least one meeting)
-	Create high-level user stories for the 3 core features. Missing 3/4
-	Create some issues (a few sub userstory of core features) under the milestone of the next sprint
-	Meaningful commits description (Most of the commit messages are meaningful and correctly describe the commit)
-	Commits referenced with issue numbers (Have at least one commit referenced with an issue)
-	Do pull requests & review them.
-	Assign some pull request / issue to members to work on them & everyone should participate in the contributions (i.e., we are able to see the contribution somewhere in your repo)

Please put your name next to the part that you will be working on. Every part is worth 0.5/5
Thank you. Amir
