=> Q: Create high-level user stories for the 3 core features.

1. Customer adding items to cart and checking out:

The user must be logged in as a Customer. The user may navigate the store "aisles" by clicking on the appropriate link from the drop-down list in the nav bar. Clicking on an 
item from the aisle will open a page that gives additional information about that item, and prompt the user to enter the quantity of said item to be added to the cart. 
Clicking on Cancel will close this page. Clicking on the "add to cart" button will display the image, the price and the quantity of the added item in the "Your Cart" page. 
From the cart page, the user may modify the quantity of each item in their cart, or remove it completely using the buttons in the row of each item. The "Clear Cart" button 
will remove all items from the cart, and the "Checkout" button begins the checkout process. This process beings by calculating and displaying the total price of the items 
in the cart, and the user may confirm or cancel their order using the provided buttons. Cancelling leads the user to the cart page, with the items intact in their cart. 
Checking out first ensures that enough of the desired items exist in the database, prompting the user to modify the quantity of items which surpass that amount. If there 
are no issues, a popup displays a thank-you message and removes the amount of items purchased from the database.

**PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT**

2. Seller adding item to their shop:

As a seller, I want to add a new item to my shop so that I can sell it online through the website. I am ready to sell a new merchandise that does not already exist in my online
store. To do that, I would like to first be able to click on a "Add a Product" button. Then, I want to be able to enter the name of the product as well as the price at which I 
want to sell it at. Afterwards, I want to add a text description of my new item to explain in details what it does, what is included, etc. as well as images and pictures to 
showcase what my product looks like. If there are variations of my product such as different colours and/or sizes, I would like to be able to include them in the same page as
well. Finally, I would like to have the option to click on an "Edit" button, so that I can change my product listing in the future if ever I want to.
